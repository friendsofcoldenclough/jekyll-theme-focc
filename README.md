# Freinds of Colden Clough Jekyll theme

The jekyll theme used in the Friends of Colden Clough organisation GitHub pages sites.

To use this theme on other jekyll-based sites, you will need to add the following to your `_config.yml` Jekyll configuration file:

```yaml
remote_theme: friendsofcoldenclough/jekyll-theme-focc
```

This theme has hard-coded elements in some templates, so all sites will have the same navigation elements in the header and footer. Some content, such as icons and manifests, are also hard-coded to point to the organisation pages site content.
